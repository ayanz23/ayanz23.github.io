As a member of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) from December 2021 to March 2024, I demonstrated strong leadership and technical skills through competitive success at both state and national levels. I led a three-person team in the animation competition category, where we conceptualized, created, and presented complex animated solutions for business scenarios. Our team's success was built on a foundation of creative problem-solving, technical expertise in animation software, and professional presentation skills. The competition process involved developing original animated content, followed by delivering comprehensive presentations to panels of industry judges. Our work earned first place at the state level in both 2022 and 2023, advancing us to national finals where we competed against top teams from across the country. This experience enhanced my abilities in project management, team leadership, public speaking, and demonstrated my capacity to excel in high-pressure competitive environments while maintaining professional standards.
