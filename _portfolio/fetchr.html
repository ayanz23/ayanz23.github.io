<b>Built with:</b> React.js, Node.js, Swift, Python, Firebase

Fetchr was created in Oct 2025 as part of HackRU Fall 2025 at Rutgers University–New Brunswick.
The project focused on delivering real-time pet safety monitoring with GPS tracking, sensor analytics,
and AI-powered alerts.

During the hackathon, we combined hardware data streaming with cloud services and a mobile interface so
owners can see where their pets are and how they are doing at any moment. The Devpost submission captures
the whole build and demo.
