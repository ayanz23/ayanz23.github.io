As a former member of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) in high school, I demonstrated strong leadership and
technical skills through competitive success at both state and national levels.

I led a three person team in the digital animation competition category, where we conceptualized, created, and presented
complex digital animations for business scenarios. Our team's success was built on a foundation of creative problem
solving, technical expertise in animation software, and professional presentation skills.

The competition process involved developing a storyboard outline, original animated content, followed by delivering
comprehensive presentations to panels of industry judges. Our work earned first place at the state level in both 2022
and 2023, advancing us to national finals where we competed against top teams from across the country.

This experience enhanced my abilities in project management, team leadership, and public speaking.
