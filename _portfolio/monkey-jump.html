<b>Built with:</b> Godot Engine, GDScript

<br>

Monkey Jump is an entertaining endless runner game inspired by Chrome's dinosaur game but with unique twists and
enhanced gameplay mechanics.

Developed using the Godot game engine, the game features procedurally generated obstacles, smooth movements, and
progressive difficulty scaling.

The development process involved creating precise collision detection systems.

Special attention was paid to game feel through careful tweaking of character physics, jump mechanics, and obstacle
timing.
