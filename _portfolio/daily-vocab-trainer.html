The Daily Vocabulary Trainer is an iOS application designed to make vocabulary learning engaging and effective. Through an intuitive flashcard interface, users can save bookmarks, test their knowledge through multiple quiz formats, and practice spelling through dictation exercises.  

The development process focused on creating a smooth user experience and immediate feedback on user responses. Core Data was used for local storage of vocabulary lists and user progress tracking, while AVFoundation handles text-to-speech functionality for pronunciation practice.
