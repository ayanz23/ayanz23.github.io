Daily Vocabulary Trainer is an iOS application designed to make vocabulary learning engaging and effective. 
The development process focused on creating a smooth user experience, first being intended to help high school students level up their vocabulary in preparation for the SAT. 
Through an intuitive flashcard interface, users can bookmark words, test their knowledge through multiple choice quiz formats, and practice spelling.  
Core Data was used for local storage of bookmarks and user score progress tracking, while AVFoundation handles text-to-speech functionality for spelling and pronounciation practice.
