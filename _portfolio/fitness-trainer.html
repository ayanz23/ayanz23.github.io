Here is a test of my program with a YouTube video I found demonstating squat form (<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/XlZy29qJDj8">Here is the original video</a>).

<br>

<b>Built with:</b> Python

<br>

Fitness Trainer is a sophisticated computer program that uses advanced pose estimation libraries to analyze squat form.
By leveraging OpenPose and MediaPipe, the software can detect human body keypoints with high precision, enabling
accurate pose identification.
The application processes live video input to detect and map body joint landmarks, calculate joint angles and body
alignment, and provide feedback for the users squat form.
Development centered on creating an accessible tool that allows for high-quality fitness instruction, making guidance
available to anyone with a camera and passion for exercise and their health.
