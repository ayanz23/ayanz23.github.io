Super excited to finally share something my friends and I have been working on all summer: Scarlet Sync! Weâ€™ve created a completely revamped and modern take on course scheduling and degree planning at Rutgers.

We spent a ton of time digging through Rutgers sites and brainstorming to build a scheduling experience from the ground up. Scarlet Sync is packed with features to make your life easier:

<ul>
  <li><b>Advanced Course Scheduler:</b> Set detailed preferences to find the perfect schedule.</li>
  <li><b>Unlimited Course Sniper:</b> Instantly snag open seats (we're talking reload times as fast as 5 seconds!). ðŸŽ¯</li>
  <li><b>Detailed Course & Degree Info Explorer:</b> Get all the info you need in one place.</li>
  <li><b>Prerequisite & GPA Calculator:</b> Plan your academic path with ease.</li>
  <li><b>Degree Planner:</b> Visualize your entire degree journey.</li>
  <li><b>Shareable Schedules:</b> Easily share your awesome schedule with your friends and sign up for the same classes! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º</li>
</ul>
