<b>Built with:</b> Godot Engine, GDScript  

<br>

Monkey Jump is an entertaining endless runner game inspired by Chrome's dinosaur game but with unique twists and enhanced gameplay mechanics.  

Developed using the Godot game engine, the game features procedurally generated obstacles, smooth movements, and progressive difficulty scaling. The development process involved creating precise collision detection systems. Special attention was paid to game feel through careful tweaking of jump mechanics and obstacle timing.  

The project showcased the capabilities of GDScript for game logic implementation and Godot's built in physics engine for realistic movement patterns.
