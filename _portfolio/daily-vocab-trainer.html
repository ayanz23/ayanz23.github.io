Daily Vocabulary Trainer is an iOS application designed to make vocabulary learning engaging and effective. Through an intuitive flashcard interface, users can bookmark words, test their knowledge through multiple quiz formats, and practice spelling.  

The development process focused on creating a smooth user experience and immediate feedback on user responses. Core Data was used for local storage of bookmarks and user score progress tracking, while AVFoundation handles text-to-speech functionality for spelling and pronounciation practice.
